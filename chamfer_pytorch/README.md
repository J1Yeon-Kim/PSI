https://github.com/ThibaultGROUEIX/ChamferDistancePytorch/tree/719b0f1ca5ba370616cb837c03ab88d9a88173ff

Include a *CUDA version*, and a *python version* with pytorch ops.

Run 

`python setup.py install`

TODO:

* Discuss behaviour of torch.min() and tensor.min() which causes issues in some pytorch versions
* Make it multi-GPU
* Provide better Unit-tests
